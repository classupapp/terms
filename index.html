  <div id="tf-terms">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
        <p class="terms-item-content">Welcome to ClassUp! We are a monthly subscription service that gives our members access to the best fitness studios in Hong Kong. The ClassUp website (the “Site”) is operated by Cramclub Company Limited (“ClassUp”). Please read carefully the following Terms of Use, which may be updated by ClassUp from time to time without notice to you (the Terms of Use, as modified from time to time, the “Terms”). The most current version of the Terms can be accessed at any time at http://ClassUpApp.com/terms.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-item-title">ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS OF USE</h2>
        <p class="terms-item-content">By accessing, browsing, and/or using the Site, you accept and agree to be bound to these Terms. In addition, when using particular ClassUp services, you also shall be subject to any posted guidelines, FAQs, or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted and modified from time to time.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-item-title">MEMBERSHIP</h2>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Members receive classes per membership cycle (“Eligible Classes”) to be used to visit any studio of their choice available on our platform up to 3 times during each such membership cycle. Members cannot transfer or gift classes to third parties, including other ClassUp members. ClassUp reserves the right to increase from time to time in its sole discretion the number of Eligible Classes a member can take in a given cycle (such as pursuant to certain promotions that we may offer from time to time). The most classes a member can take at any 1 studio in a cycle is 3 classes. Please note that if a studio has more than 1 location, members can go up to 3 times total across all of its locations, and not 3 times per location. ClassUp makes no guarantee on the availability of classes as access to classes is on a space-available basis.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-item-title">MEMBERSHIP CYCLE</h2>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Your ClassUp membership starts on the date that you sign up for a subscription and submit payment via a valid Payment Method. Each ClassUp cycle is one month in length, and will automatically renew each month. For example, if you purchase your ClassUp on April 5, your membership will automatically renew on May 5 (see “Billing Cycles,” below). Once your new month starts, you will receive your full number of Eligible Classes for such new monthly cycle. Please note that any Eligible Classes not used during a monthly membership cycle are forfeited, and will not be exercisable in the next subscription cycle.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, “Payment Method”) to use ClassUp. We will automatically bill the monthly membership fee to your Payment Method each month until your ClassUp is cancelled or terminated.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-item-title">BILLING</h2>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Recurring Billing. By starting your ClassUp membership, you authorize us to charge you a monthly membership fee at the then current rate.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Billing Cycle. When you sign up and purchase your ClassUp, your first subscription cycle will be billed immediately. Your subscription will auto-renew and you will be billed on the same date each month. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your ClassUp membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Membership.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">No Refunds. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (“credits”). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by emailing us at cs@ClassUpApp.com or calling us at +852-6374-0278. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, “Cancellation” below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Cancellation. You may terminate your monthly subscription at any time with 15 days notice by emailing us at cs@ClassUpApp.com. However, your first month cannot be cancelled and is non-refundable. For example, if your next billing date is September 30th, you need to cancel by September 15th in order to avoid being charged for the next month. Note that if you do terminate your membership, there is a $635 reactivation fee if you want to return to the ClassUp in future months.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Hold. In lieu of cancellation, we also give you the option to put your membership on hold at any time, subject to a reduced fee of $150 per billing cycle. Please notify cs@ClassUpApp.com at least 3 days prior to your next billing date if you want to put your membership on hold. (i.e., if your next billing date is September 30th, notify ClassUp that you want to put your membership on hold by September 27th.) Even though your membership will be on hold, your account is left active and functioning and you will be able to book one (1) class per month with your ClassUp. There is no reactivation fee to return to a full Eligible Class membership. Please just email us at cs@ClassUpApp.com at least 3 days prior to your next billing date if you want to reactivate your full Eligible Class membership. If your membership is on hold and you wish to cancel your membership, you may cancel at any time with 15 days notice by emailing us at cs@ClassUpApp.com.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-item-title">OTHER FEES</h2>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Your ClassUp covers your access to classes. In addition, you are responsible for paying cancellation fees if you do not cancel your class with appropriate notice. Some of our venues may also charge equipment or other amenity fees. The ClassUp only gives you access to the class for which you signed up. The venue may have additional fees for use of additional classes or spaces.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-item-title">TERMINATION BY CLASSUP</h2>
        <p class="terms-item-content">You agree that ClassUp, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate any account (or any part thereof) you may have with ClassUp or use of the Site and remove and discard all or any part of your account or any content uploaded by you, at any time. ClassUp may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing access to the Site, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Site or any account you may have or portion thereof may be effected without prior notice, and you agree that ClassUp will not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination. ClassUp does not permit copyright infringing activities on the Site and reserves the right to terminate access to the Site and remove all content submitted by any persons who are found to be repeat infringers. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Site may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies ClassUp may have at law or in equity.</p>

ClassUp cannot guarantee any anonymity or confidentiality with respect to any User Submissions, and strongly recommends that you think carefully about what you upload to the Site. You understand that all User Submissions are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such User Submission originated.

        <p class="terms-item-content">Please see our Digital Millennium Copyright Act document for an explanation of our copyright and trademark policies.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-item-title">DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
        <p class="terms-item-content">General. Generally, if a dispute arises between ClassUp and you, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and ClassUp agree that the parties will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or the Site (a “Claim”) in accordance with one of the subsections below or as you and we otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Choice of Law; Forum. These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the Laws of Hong Kong (without reference to other conflicts of laws provisions thereof). You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against ClassUp must be resolved by a court located in Hong Kong, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Hong Kong for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Arbitration Option. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding, non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

        <h2 class="terms-item-title">MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Headings. The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and ClassUp relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms or Guidelines made by ClassUp as set forth in the Preamble to these Terms.</p>
        <p class="terms-item-content">Claims; Statute of Limitations. YOU AND CLASSUP AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
